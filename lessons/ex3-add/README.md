Adding Numbers
==============

Use the "+" operator to add variables (or literal values) together.

```
  x = y + z;     // x will now be equal to the sum of y and z
  x = y + 10;    // x will now be equal to the sum of y and 10
  x = a + b + c; // x will now be equal to the sum of a, b, and c
```  

Exercise
========

Write a program that initialize three variables named u, v, and w, with their intial
values set to 50, 60, and 70, respectively.

Print the three values along with the name of the corresponding variable.

Set u equal to the sum of v plus w.
Set v equal to w plus 20.
Set w equal to v + 100.

Print all three values and variable names again.

Sample Output
=============

```
u = 50
v = 60
w = 70
u = 130
v = 90
w = 190
```
