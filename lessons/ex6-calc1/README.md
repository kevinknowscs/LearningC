Writing a Calculator Program
============================

In this lesson we'll begin one of the projects we'll be working
on through these series of lessons - to write an interactive
calculator program.

Eventually the calculator program will do all sorts of interesting
mathematical operations for the user, but we're going to start with
a very simple program - a program that will add two numbers the user
enters.

You already know everything you need to write this program:

* You've learned how to declare variables
* You've learned how to add variables
* You've learned how to read input from the user
* You've learned how to print numbers using printf and %d

Let's put it all together into an actual program.

Exercise
========

Write a program that prompts the user for two numbers, then prints
out the two numbers along with their some:

Expected ouptut:

```
Enter your first number: 5
Enter your second number: 6
5 + 6 = 11
```
